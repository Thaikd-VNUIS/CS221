\section*{Problem 3}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \ 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{states:} A tuple of (index of previous word, possible previous word).
        \item \textbf{initial state:} (0, "-BEGIN-").
        \item \textbf{actions:} Every possible words generated from every string starts from current state index.
        \item \textbf{cost:} Cost of previous word and current action word.
        \item \textbf{end test:} Whether previous state index equals to length of the whole string.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item
        Keep the settings as (a) and modifies cost only, then cost is a function of only current action word. \\
        \begin{equation}
            Cost(w) = u_b(w) = \min_{w'}{b(w',w)}
        \end{equation}
        Then we can prove
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Consistency(1): $0 \le u_b(w) \le b(w', w)$ for all $w'$.
            \item Consistency(2): When the state hit the end, there is no future action, which means the cost is 0.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
